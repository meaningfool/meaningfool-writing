# Testing Frontmatter Validation

This article was originally created with incorrect frontmatter to test our validation system, but has now been fixed.

## What Was Fixed?

The frontmatter was corrected from:
- `name` → `title`
- `created` → `date`
- `categories` → `tags`

## Validation Success

Now that all frontmatter is correct, this article should pass validation and be publishable along with the other content.
