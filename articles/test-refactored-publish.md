# Testing Refactored Publish Pipeline

This is a test article to verify that our newly refactored publish command works correctly with the modular script architecture.

## What We're Testing

- **Frontmatter validation** using `.claude/scripts/frontmatter-validation.sh`
- **Content update workflow** using `.claude/scripts/run-content-update.sh`
- **Deployment workflow** using `.claude/scripts/run-deployment.sh`
- **Clean publish command** that orchestrates all the above

## Expected Behavior

1. Validation should pass (this article has proper frontmatter)
2. Content update should succeed
3. Deployment should succeed
4. Article should appear on the live site

## Technical Details

The refactored publish command is now much cleaner:
- Separated concerns into focused scripts
- Each script handles one workflow completely
- Main command is readable and maintainable
- Better error handling and reporting

If you're reading this on https://meaningfool.github.io/, the test was successful!
