# Cost of Change is Agile's ceiling

**Agile depends on slicing the work.**
Smaller chunks mean delivering value faster.
Smaller chunks mean the ability to reduce WIP and increase flow.
That's what I kept hearing and reading about.


**Until I discovered it's only half of the story.**
Cutting things into ever tinier pieces
Won't move the needle if cost of change is high.


**Cost of change is what it sounds like:**
It's the time it costs for making a change, but also planning, debugging, deploying...


**High Cost of change incentivizes Anticipation**
Costly changes mean: you better know precisely what you are doing before you do it.
Costly changes mean: it makes sense to invest time in upfront planning and design.


**High Cost of change incentivizes larger scopes and fewer iterations.**
Because 2 small changes are more expensive than a larger one.


**Cost of Change is Agile's ceiling.**
When change is expensive, waterfall is the rational choice.


**But product people don't talk about it (or do they?)**
Even though cost of change implies some "management overhead"
Or maybe precisely because some people's role exist only thanks to that overhead. 


**So what happens if/when AI collapses the software cost of change?**
Do we finally get to be more Agile?
How does product management shift?
