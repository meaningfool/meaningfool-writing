# We Can't Stop Planning (Even When We Should)

**We are pathological planners.**
We should have a word for that. Something like *planopathia anticipationis* maybe.
We plan because of incentives and psychological urges.

**We plan because it feels professional and responsible**.
Anticipating future problems signals expertise.
Unpreparedness signals incompetence.

**We plan because we can't resist adding to the list.**
We hoard ideas, good and bad, scared we might forget.
We order, reorder, discuss, schedule and align.
We love tending to those little lists of ours.

**We plan because we fear uncertainty.**
What if...? What if...? What if...?
We need the sense of control it provides.

**Planning makes sense when your survival depends on it**
Planning is an evolutionary moat that we climbed.
When bad decisions can lead to an irreversible death, accurate anticipation is highly valuable.
And over-planning is preferable to under-planning.

**But where change is cheap,**
When you can revert past decisions at no cost,
When you can switch directions instantly,
Anticipation is not only a waste of time,
Anticipation is also a waste of optionality.

**Cost of change is dropping and we did not notice**
Or rather our hardwired brain has a hard time adjusting.
Meaning we miss-allocate our energy where cost of change used to be high,
Instead of where it remains relatively higher.

**AI scrambles the Cost of change landscape.**
Deliberately avoiding planning,
Resisting the incentives to anticipate,
Are relevant strategies until the dust settles.
