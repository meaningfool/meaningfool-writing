## Learnings

- **Consolidated project documentation**:
  - Merged dispersed docs (`project.md`, `specs/README.md`, `specs/TESTING.md`) into single authoritative `AGENT.md`
  - Enriched `restore-context` workflow with project overview, golden rules, and "how to start" guidance
  - Intent: Reduce context switching and ensure critical information is provided exactly when needed

- **Structured AGENT.md as a user manual**:
  - How to Create/Start a Feature
  - How to Write Specs (Vertical Slices, Impact Analysis)
  - How to Write Tests (E2E-First, POM, Fixtures)
  - How to Run Tests and Debug
  - How to Write Learnings (Retrospective vs Log)

- **Refactoring strategy**: Un-suppress and Fix (Slice-based refactoring).
- **Type validation**: Implemented Zod for runtime validation (replacing manual casts).
