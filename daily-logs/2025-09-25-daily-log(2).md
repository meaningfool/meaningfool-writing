## ANALYSIS

- **Daily command architecture overhaul to achieve maintainability**:
  - Details: Intent was to replace complex multi-script system with single streamlined script for easier debugging and maintenance
  - Details: Decision made to eliminate intermediate files and caching in favor of direct data flow from script to Claude

- **GitHub API optimization through architectural research**:
  - Details: Research revealed GitHub Search API only indexes default branches, limiting feature branch commit discovery
  - Details: Chose commit-first approach (search by date) over repository-first approach for efficiency - single API call vs dozens

- **Process improvement through structured planning methodology**:
  - Details: Used detailed 95-task plan with 9 phases to manage complex refactoring, demonstrating systematic approach
  - Details: Plan file served dual purpose as roadmap and documentation of implementation decisions and progress tracking

## RAW COMMITS

Repository: meaningfool/meaningfool-writing
Commit: [a08b941c0391fa908413a7d862706827d1a91a56] Complete daily command refactoring implementation
Description:
  Successfully refactored /daily command from multi-script system to single streamlined script.

  Changes:
  - Completed all integration tests for various date formats
  - Updated CLAUDE.md with /daily command documentation and examples
  - Marked all plan items (1-9) as complete
  - Verified removal of all old artifacts from previous implementation

  The daily command now:
  - Supports multiple date formats (today, yesterday, -N, YYYY-MM-DD)
  - Generates numbered files when duplicates exist
  - Uses GitHub Search API efficiently (single API call)
  - Outputs structured data for Claude analysis

  All planned functionality has been implemented and tested successfully.

Commit: [097736953fe9a2fb8678c2d185376ba8cf46dbaa] Create daily.md command file for /daily slash command
Description:
  - Add daily.md command file with proper tool permissions (Write, Bash)
  - Include script execution directive for daily.sh with argument passing
  - Add comprehensive Claude analysis instructions focusing on technical challenges, new technologies, and AI process improvements
  - Structure command file with clear Instructions and Retrieved commits sections
  - Update plan to mark step 7 as completed

  LEARNINGS:
  - GitHub Search API only indexes default branches (no feature branch commits)
  - No single API endpoint retrieves all commits across all branches by date
  - Events API limited to 30 days/300 events, not suitable for historical data
  - Full iteration (reposâ†’branchesâ†’commits) would be slow and hit rate limits
  - Current approach is optimal for daily log use case

Repository: meaningfool/meaningfool-writing
Commit: [502c007f56ab7e2e181c336a31b3de23099429da] Update daily command plan with better GitHub API approach
Description:
  Change fetch_commits strategy from repository-first to commit-first approach:
  - Use GitHub Search API to find commits by date directly
  - Group results by repository instead of checking each repo individually
  - More efficient single API call vs dozens of individual repo checks

  LEARNINGS:
  - GitHub doesn't provide single API to "find all repos with commits on date X"
  - Two approaches exist: repository-first vs commit-first
  - Repository-first: List all repos, check each for commits (inefficient, many API calls)
  - Commit-first: Search commits by date, group by repo (efficient, single API call)
  - GitHub Search API supports: gh api "/search/commits?q=author:USERNAME+committer-date:YYYY-MM-DD"
  - Search-first approach benefits: one API call, only active repos, faster, avoids rate limits
  - Official docs confirm both valid but search-first preferred for efficiency

Commit: [895331930e06c2610f2b34443cbcbce00e2d2112] Implement check_output_file function with automatic numbering
Description:
  - Add check_output_file function to handle daily log file naming
  - Check for base filename in daily-logs folder (not root)
  - Implement automatic numbering for duplicate files
  - Support format: daily-logs/YYYY-MM-DD-daily-log.md, then (2), (3), etc.
  - Test all scenarios: no file, one existing file, multiple numbered files
  - Update plan to mark check_output_file tasks as completed

  The function ensures unique filenames when running daily command multiple
  times for the same date without overwriting existing logs.

+- **No intermediate files** - data flows directly from script to Claude
+- **No caching** - fresh execution every time
+- **Local timezone** instead of UTC for more intuitive date handling
+- **Simplified file naming** - automatic numbering for duplicates
+- **Direct output** - script outputs all data for Claude in one execution
+
+### Technical Details
+- Use GitHub CLI (`gh`) for all API calls
+- Handle rate limiting gracefully with error messages
+- Output format optimized for Claude's analysis
+- All functions contained in single `daily.sh` file
+- Command file (`daily.md`) contains Claude's analysis instructions
+
+### Expected Outcomes
+- Simpler, more maintainable codebase
+- Faster execution (no intermediate file I/O)
+- Easier debugging (single script to troubleshoot)
+- More reliable (fewer moving parts)
+- Better user experience (clearer error messages)
\ No newline at end of file

+# Specification: Refactored Daily Command
+
+## Overview
+Simplify the `/daily` command to generate development logs by fetching GitHub commits for a specified date and having Claude analyze them for insights.
+
+## Requirements
+
+### Input
+- Date parameter that can take forms:
+  - Empty (defaults to today)
+  - `yesterday`
+  - `-N` (N days ago, e.g., `-3`)
+  - `YYYY-MM-DD` (specific date)
+
+### Output
+- Creates a file in root directory: `YYYY-MM-DD-daily-log.md`
+- If file exists, creates numbered versions: `YYYY-MM-DD-daily-log(2).md`, `YYYY-MM-DD-daily-log(3).md`, etc.
+- File contains Claude's analysis of the day's commits
+
+### Core Functionality
+1. Validate date parameter
+2. Check for existing output file and determine filename
+3. Fetch all commits from all repos for TARGET_DATE (local timezone)
+4. Pass commit data to Claude for analysis
+5. Claude writes insights to output file
+
+## Architecture
+
+### Single Script Approach
+- One script file: `.claude/scripts/daily.sh`
+- Contains functions that can be called internally
+- Single execution outputs all data needed for Claude
+
+### Script Structure (`daily.sh`)
+
+```bash
+#!/usr/bin/env bash
+
+validate_date() {
+    # Input: date argument (empty, "yesterday", "-3", "2025-09-11", etc.)
+    # Output: YYYY-MM-DD format
+    # Uses local timezone
+}
+
+get_time_range() {
+    # Input: validated date in YYYY-MM-DD
+    # Output: START_TIME and END_TIME in ISO format with local timezone
+    # Example: 2025-09-25T00:00:00-07:00 2025-09-25T23:59:59-07:00
+}
+
+check_output_file() {
+    # Input: target date YYYY-MM-DD
+    # Output: available filename
+    # Logic: Check for existing files, find highest (N), return next available
+    # Examples:
+    #   - No file exists â†’ 2025-09-25-daily-log.md
+    #   - File exists â†’ 2025-09-25-daily-log(2).md
+    #   - (2) exists â†’ 2025-09-25-daily-log(3).md
+}
+
+fetch_commits() {
+    # Input: target_date, start_time, end_time
+    # Output: formatted commit data
+    # Uses: gh api to fetch commits from all repos with activity
+    # Filters: only repos with commits on target date
+    # Format:
+    #   Repository: user/repo-name
+    #   Commit: [sha] commit message
+    #   Files: file1.js, file2.md
+    #   [blank line between repos]
+}
+
+main() {
+    # Orchestrates all functions
+    # Outputs metadata and commit data for Claude
+}
+```

+- **Technical challenges solved** - what specific problems were encountered, how they were debugged, and what solutions were implemented. For this look specifically at code file diffs and at changes in plans that are reflected in .md files.
+- **New technologies, specific findings about how their idiosyncracies** - trials and mistakes lead, and research, lead to discoveries about why things won't work or work only in certain ways. This is useful knowledge that we want to surface. For that look in particular at .md files which un packs our thinking, our plans, what we tried, and our research.
+- **AI process improvements or setbacks** - the AI-assisted development process is harnessed using .md files. Some of them contain general instructions (claude.md), some capture automation processes (in .claude). And some others (those that contains plans, or logs of what happened for example) support the AI-assisted development process to store short-term memories mostly and keep track of what was done and what needs to be done. For these last ones, it's not so much the exact content than how they are used to support the development process that is interesting. So analyze all those files to identify if and how we changed the process.
+
+Each extracted item is formatted a new bullet point. And for each extracted item provide some details in the form of up to 3 sub-bullet points each of one sentence maximum.
+
+It should look like so:
+- **Item title A**:
+  - Description sentence 1
+  - Description sentence 2
+- **Item title B**:
+  - Description sentence 1
+  - Description sentence 2
+  - Description sentence 3
+- An so on...

+[Claude processes commits and writes analysis to OUTPUT_FILE]
+```
+
+## Data Flow
+
+1. User runs `/daily` or `/daily yesterday` or `/daily -3` etc.
+2. `daily.sh` executes with the argument
+3. Script validates date â†’ determines time range â†’ checks output file â†’ fetches commits
+4. All data outputs to stdout and becomes part of Claude's prompt
+5. Claude analyzes commits according to instructions
+6. Claude writes formatted analysis to the output file
+
+## Key Differences from Current Implementation
+
+### Removed
+- Multiple script files (fetch-commits.sh, prepare-analysis.sh, utils.sh)
+- Session files and environment variables
+- Intermediate data storage in `.daily/` directory
+- Caching and data reuse logic
+- Complex phase-based execution
+- File patches and detailed diffs (keeping just commit messages and file names)
+
+### Simplified
+- Single script execution
+- No intermediate files
+- Direct output to Claude's context
+- Local timezone instead of UTC
+- Straightforward file numbering for duplicates
+
+## Implementation Notes
+
+- Use GitHub CLI (`gh`) for API calls
+- Handle rate limiting gracefully
+- Include only repos with commits on target date
+- Keep output format simple and parseable
+- Error handling for invalid dates or API failures
\ No newline at end of file
