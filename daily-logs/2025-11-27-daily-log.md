## Learning

- **Evolved the Graph Layout Algorithm Through Iterative Specification**:
  - Started with a Multi-Pass Anchoring strategy (3 passes: anchor to Output, Input, then Islands)
  - Simplified to Single Pass Sink-Anchored strategy after recognizing the complexity was unnecessary

- **Defined Comprehensive Test Cases for Invalid Graphs**:
  - Expanded from 2 test cases to 10 distinct scenarios covering edge cases:
    - Invalid Source Direction (backward Output edge)
    - Missing Output (Input Chain) / Missing Input (Output Chain)
    - Isolated Chain (no Input, no Output - "Islands")
    - Mixed scenarios: Valid Chain + Missing Output/Input/Isolated Chain
    - Input-Input and Output-Output connections
    - Input-Only Graph (degenerate case)
  - Each test case now has explicit, testable assertions for both layer indices and visual coordinates

- **Established Two-Layer Testing Strategy**:
  - Layer 1 (Algorithm Logic): Use `data-layer` attribute on nodes for E2E tests to verify computed layer indices
  - Layer 2 (Visual Rendering): Assert relative X-coordinates to verify correct rendering
  - Benefits: Decouples logic verification from pixel-perfect rendering; failures indicate which layer failed
