# Activity Log - 2025-09-25

- **Daily command architecture overhaul**:
  - /daily called multiple bash scripts and intermediate files for no good reason
  - The initial effort did not rely on the newly-gained understanding that bash commands are executed first, the output incorporated in the command prompt, and the whole thing is passed to Claude
  - Also mutliple bash scripts in the command cannot share information (hence the original need of external files)
  - New approach: 
    - Generate the list of commits using a bash script, pass it all to Claude so that it can create the summary
    - No more caching of the results or complex decision rules about when to generate a file or not

- **GitHub API limitation to access the history of commits**:
  - GitHub Search API only indexes default branches.
  - Alternative strategies were identified as brittle or complex: https://chatgpt.com/share/68d593f0-a81c-8010-833a-d1a7eaccebd7 
  - Decision to retrieve only default branches commits. This will be a forcing-function for short-lived branches. Maybe a good thing.

- **Tested new planning methodology**:
  - Recent setbacks trying to organize issues led to testing a new approach even for seemingly simple features : 
    - Start with spec document. Iterate.
    - Generate detailed plan. Iterate.
    - When approach changes, update the plan and the specs, explain why in the commit
  - PROs:
    - Decisions are not lost in past conversations. Context can be ported from one convo to the next.
    - Living documentation of the decisions
  - CONs:
    - The spec is out of date at the end: I failed to update it consistently
  - NEXT:
    - To be perfected for larger changes / codebases
    - Contrast with self-claimed "spec-driven" approaches such as kilo and Tessl
