## Readings

- “If I can cut a 20 person team that I manage down to 4 or 5 highly accountable and AI empowered senior engineers that report directly to me, then I don’t even need a project manager. I might not even need business analysts” https://obie.medium.com/what-happens-when-the-coding-becomes-the-least-interesting-part-of-the-work-ab10c213c660

## Learnings

- **Refactoring strategy**: Avoid 'Big Bang' replacements; favor Iterative Refactoring (Structure -> Visuals) to prevent drift and confusion.
- **E2E Testing Architecture**: Use Strict Page Object Model and abstract Intent ('selectProperty') over Implementation ('click(".pill")') to protect against UI changes.
- **Component Architecture**: Use Data-Driven UI (Blueprints/Engines) over manual JSX scripting to ensure consistency and reduce code volume.
