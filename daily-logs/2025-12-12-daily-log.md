## Commit Learnings

> * Refactoring Strategy: Avoid 'Big Bang' replacements; favor Iterative Refactoring (Structure -> Visuals) to prevent drift and confusion.
> * E2E Testing Architecture: Use Strict Page Object Model and abstract Intent ('selectProperty') over Implementation ('click(".pill")') to protect against UI changes.
> * Component Architecture: Use Data-Driven UI (Blueprints/Engines) over manual JSX scripting to ensure consistency and reduce code volume.
