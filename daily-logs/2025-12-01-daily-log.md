## Analysis

- **Reorganized spec folders with number-based naming**:
  - Changed from date-based (`2025-11-19-csv-import`) to implementation-order naming (`02-csv-import`)
  - Rationale: Numbers reflect chronological implementation order, making project history clearer
  - New policy: Features get numbered when work begins (branch created), planned features remain unnumbered
  - Updated README.md to document the new naming convention
