# Activity Log - 2025-09-16

**Context engineering**
- Latent.space podcast: Context Engineering for Agents - Lance Martin
  - Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IlTcWciEC4
  - Additionnal resources (in the yt video and in https://x.com/RLanceMartin/status/1966204974150680803)
  - Personal highlights:
    - "Summarization is hard": it resonates with my efforts to create a daily activity summary
    - Agentic search is more efficient in code than semantic search: mimics human processes, low-level tooling (file system)
