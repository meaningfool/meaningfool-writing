# Activity Log - 2025-09-15

- **Harnessing Claude Code**:
  - Collected a few repo consolidating CC harnesses (slash commands, hooks, subagents): 
  - Read Claude doc in details about harnessing features
  - Investigated with ChatGPT what emergent usage patterns can be found for slash commands, hooks, subagents, Output styles
    - Convo: https://chatgpt.com/share/68cac39c-93ac-8010-9b12-e787d6539d70
    - Findings: 
      - Subagents seem an appropriate way to manage context in some cases
      - Hooks seem both powerful, but usage patterns are still unclear to me
      - Output styles: usage pattern are quite obvious but to overwrite CC system prompt does not look like a trivial endeavor to do well. Would need a way to generate good output styles

- **Bypassing "thinking" to create "fast commands"**:
  - Investigated with ChatGPT how I could create "fast commands", i.e. predefined commands that would not necessitate any thinking:
  - Convo: https://chatgpt.com/share/68cabdd5-9a08-8010-abd9-536e3df174b7
  - Findings: 
    - An elegant way to do that is to use hooks to intercept the command, run a predefined script and stop after the hook. 
    - A second option would be to use the Haiku model instead of Sonnet / Opus used by default in CC. To be investigated if that can be set for a specific scope within a session or if it's a session-wide setting.

- **Backlog tooling**:
  - Claude task master: https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master
    - MCP tool: preference for a CLI tool if possible
  - Backlog.md: https://deepwiki.com/MrLesk/Backlog.md
    - CLI tool: looks appropriate
    - Need to test the fit and investigate further its features
