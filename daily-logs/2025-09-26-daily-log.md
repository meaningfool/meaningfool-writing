- **Daily log command refinement**: 
  - Problem: daily logs lack specificity. The attempt is to improve the capturing of relevant context / intent on one end (=improve signal) and focus the context passed to the daily command on the right data (=reduce noise)
  - Improve the signal: started on yesterday, generate spec and plan files that capture the context and the research, as well as the change in direction. Still have to refine how / when to use them.
  - Reduce the noise: instead of passing diffs for all the files altered to the daily command, pass only the spec-*.md and plan-*.md markdown file diffs (i.e. focus on high intent-signaling files)

- **First try at Codex**: 
  - I'm sticking with CC for now as I want to find my workflow with it. But I already found out that ChatGPT 5 - Think is much better for research.
  - Codex is also on my single attempt able to come up with a sound plan in a single-shot where CC seems to be circling between bad options. 
  - Makes me consider even more the switch or how to make them work together using RepoPrompt
  - Hope Claude 4.5 will close the gap

- **Process documentation improvement**: Updated the daily command to focus analysis on architectural research findings and process improvements, shifting away from technical implementation minutiae toward strategic decision documentation.

- **meaningfool.net site is live**: Migrated from GitHub Pages default domain to custom domain (meaningfool.github.io â†’ meaningfool.net)
