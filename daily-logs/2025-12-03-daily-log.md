## Readings

- Steipete Whatsapp relay + « Clawd » agent: https://github.com/steipete/warelay/blob/main/docs/clawd.md
- Extensive conversation about how to host warily + Clawd and more generally how to host agents using Claude Code SDK using Cloudflare

## Learnings

- **Established Feature Completion Protocol**:
  - Use "Squash and Merge" for feature branches
  - Keep feature branches alive after merge (for reference/hotfixes)
  - Commit message MUST include insights from `learnings.md`
- **E2E testing strategy**: 
  - **Dynamic Aria-Labels**: Components (like ShadCN MultiSelect) often update `aria-label` to reflect state (e.g., "prop1, selected"). This breaks `getByRole` selectors that rely on exact name matches.
  - **Policy Reinforcement**: Always prefer state-independent attributes like `data-value` or `data-testid` over text content or accessibility labels for selection logic.
  - **Failure Protocol**: When a selector fails, do not guess. Inspect the DOM immediately to find stable attributes.
  - **Browser Subagent vs. MCP**: The Browser Subagent is a user-centric tool perfect for UI verification and "inspect element" tasks (via DOM dumps). It is distinct from the code-centric Chrome DevTools MCP, which is better for deep protocol debugging.
