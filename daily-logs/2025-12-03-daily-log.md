## Analysis

- **Implemented Node Properties feature**:
  - Auto-import: Parse extra CSV columns into `properties` object
  - Side panel: Click node to see all properties in a details panel
  - Property configuration: Multi-select component to choose which properties to import
  - Sliced implementation: Card preview (temporary) → Side panel → Refinements → UI polish

- **Debugged Radix UI Dialog + Popover scroll issue**:
  - Problem: Mouse wheel scroll blocked on Popover content inside Dialog
  - Cause: Dialog's `react-remove-scroll` interfered with nested Portals
  - Solution: Set `modal={true}` on Popover to take over modal context

- **Established Feature Completion Protocol**:
  - Use "Squash and Merge" for feature branches
  - Keep feature branches alive after merge (for reference/hotfixes)
  - Commit message MUST include insights from `learnings.md`

## Commit Learnings

> *   **Dynamic Aria-Labels**: Components (like ShadCN MultiSelect) often update `aria-label` to reflect state (e.g., "prop1, selected"). This breaks `getByRole` selectors that rely on exact name matches.
> *   **Policy Reinforcement**: Always prefer state-independent attributes like `data-value` or `data-testid` over text content or accessibility labels for selection logic.
> *   **Failure Protocol**: When a selector fails, do not guess. Inspect the DOM immediately to find stable attributes.
> *   **Browser Subagent vs. MCP**: The Browser Subagent is a user-centric tool perfect for UI verification and "inspect element" tasks (via DOM dumps). It is distinct from the code-centric Chrome DevTools MCP, which is better for deep protocol debugging.
