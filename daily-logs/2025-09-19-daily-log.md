# Activity Log - 2025-09-19

## ANALYSIS

- **Added draft folder**:
  - Intent: provide full access to my writing / publishing process, without featuring it on my website (i.e. accessible through Github only)
  - Needed a way to "publish" and article:
    - Move from _draft to articles
    - Add the required frontmatter

- **Learnings about Claude Code slash commands**:
  - All bash commands execute first, outputs become part of the prompt passed to Claude. It's like templating languages (e.g. jinja) where the script in the HTML is executed yielding an html-only file to be passed to the client.
  - No way to alternate between bash execution and Claude processing within a command (consequence of the previous item).
  - No way to pass variables or values from one bash command to another within the slash command.
  - Bash permission validation occurs before any bash commands execute
  - @ file references are intercepted by Claude's file system, not passed as bash arguments, e.g. calling /publish @article-file-name is equivalent to having no argument.

- **Learnings about tool permissions**:
  - Confirmed and tried the autorization of tools at the slash command level.
  - Note: CC really does not know how it functions itself. This had to be researched. And I would actually need to write some guidelines for it to be better at creating new slash commands.

+# Why We Can't Stop Planning (Even When We Should)
+
+Planning is a psychological need.\
+Planning is a high social-status activity.\
+Planning is self-reinforcing.
+
+
+
+We don't plan just because it's valuable. But because it's an urge.
+
+
+
+**We plan because planning feels professional and responsible**. \
+Anticipating future problems signals expertise. \
+And unanticipated issues  signal unpreparedness at best, incompetence at worst.&#x20;
+
+
+
+**We plan because we can't resist adding to the list.**\
+We can't resist "brain dumping", because it's easier than withholding or forgetting.\
+We hoard ideas, good and bad, scared  we might forget.\
+We order, reorder, discuss, schedule and align. We love grooming those lists of ours.
+
+
+
+**We plan because we fear uncertainty.**\
+We plan because we need the sense of control it provides.
+
+
+
+**We  over-index the value of planning because change is scary.**\
+We over-index the value of planning in order to justify our urge to plan. \
+We over index the value of planning because we did not keep up with the decrease of the cost of change.
+
+
+
+**When change is free,  planning is pointless.**\
+When you can revert past decisions at no cost, \
+When you can switch directions instantly, \
+Anticipation is not only a waste of time, \
+Anticipation is also a waste of optionality.
+
+
+
+**Anti-planning as the action of deliberately and actively not planning, is a skill.**\
+Anti-planning means knowing when to invest in planning, and when to delay decisions.\
+Delay decisions until the last responsible moment as would say Poppendieck.\
+Anti-planning means resisting personal and organizational urges to plan.
+
+
+
+**Anti-planning's value skyrockets as the cost of change collapses**\
+Vanishing cost of change lowers the bar as to what decisions can be delayed.\
+But people not used to actively searching to delay probably did not notice
+

Commit: [78a44c4b096704e546a8ecebab84a521de0c2972] Add /publish-article slash command for converting drafts to published articles
Description:
  - Created slash command to automate draft-to-article workflow
  - Converts _draft/XX-filename.md to articles/YYYY-MM-DD-filename.md
  - Extracts title from H1 header, adds proper frontmatter with date/tags
  - Uses git mv to preserve file history during conversion

  Key learnings about Claude Code slash commands:
  - All bash commands execute first, outputs become part of the prompt passed to Claude
  - No way to alternate between bash execution and Claude processing within a command
  - Bash permission validation occurs before any bash commands execute
  - @ file references are intercepted by Claude's file system, not passed as bash arguments
  - $1 and $ARGUMENTS don't receive @ syntax - they remain empty
