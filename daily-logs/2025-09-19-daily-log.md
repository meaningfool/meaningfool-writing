# Activity Log - 2025-09-19

- **Added draft folder**:
  - Intent: provide full access to my writing / publishing process, without featuring it on my website (i.e. accessible through Github only)
  - Needed a way to "publish" and article:
    - Move from _draft to articles
    - Add the required frontmatter

- **Learnings about Claude Code slash commands**:
  - All bash commands execute first, outputs become part of the prompt passed to Claude. It's like templating languages (e.g. jinja) where the script in the HTML is executed yielding an html-only file to be passed to the client.
  - No way to alternate between bash execution and Claude processing within a command (consequence of the previous item).
  - No way to pass variables or values from one bash command to another within the slash command.
  - Bash permission validation occurs before any bash commands execute
  - @ file references are intercepted by Claude's file system, not passed as bash arguments, e.g. calling /publish @article-file-name is equivalent to having no argument.

- **Learnings about tool permissions**:
  - Confirmed and tried the autorization of tools at the slash command level.
  - Note: CC really does not know how it functions itself. This had to be researched. And I would actually need to write some guidelines for it to be better at creating new slash commands.
