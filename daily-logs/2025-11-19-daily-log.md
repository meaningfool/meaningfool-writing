## Analysis

- **Established spec-driven development workflow**:
  - Created a structured folder system for features: `specs/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name/` containing task.md (master checklist), research.md (findings), learnings.md (insights), and numbered implementation plans
  - Designed for multi-session AI development with clear handoff points between chats
  - Intent: Enable context preservation across conversations and maintain clear "why" alongside "what"

- **Planned CSV Import feature using vertical slicing**:
  - Phase 1: Basic CSV upload for nodes only (no edges) - get something working first
  - Phase 2: Add edge support
  - Phase 3: Validation and error handling
  - Decision: Client-side parsing with papaparse, replacing hardcoded `target-lineage.json` with dynamic state

- **Codebase cleanup audit**:
  - Identified dead code: `simple-dag-generator.ts` (unused utility)
  - Found brittle tests: `page.test.tsx` mocks everything including removed dependencies (trpc)
  - Architecture observation: `page.tsx` violates separation of concerns by handling data loading, layout, AND rendering

- **Documented architectural learnings (Dagre vs Graphology)**:
  - Dagre: Use strictly for visual layout (x/y coordinates for ReactFlow)
  - Graphology: Use for structural logic (validation, cycle detection, traversal, subgraphs)
  - Lesson: Keep this separation - don't force Dagre to do logic or Graphology to do layout

- **Reset project to clean baseline**:
  - Reverted to commit 691216b (Clean ReactFlow + Vitest state)
  - Removed extensive CLAUDE.md configuration (656 lines)
  - Intent: Start fresh with cleaner foundation for new feature development
