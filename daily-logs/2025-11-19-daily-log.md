## Analysis

- **Established spec-driven development workflow**:
  - Created a structured folder system for features: `specs/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name/` containing task.md (master checklist), research.md (findings), learnings.md (insights), and numbered implementation plans
  - Designed for multi-session AI development with clear handoff points between chats
  - Intent: Enable context preservation across conversations and maintain clear "why" alongside "what"


- **Reset project to clean baseline**:
  - Reverted to commit 691216b (Clean ReactFlow + Vitest state)
  - Removed extensive CLAUDE.md configuration (656 lines)
  - Intent: Start fresh with cleaner foundation for new feature development
  - Cleaned up the codebase by removing dead code and brittle tests
