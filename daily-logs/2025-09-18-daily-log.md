# Activity Log - 2025-09-18

- **Publishing workflow changes**:
  - Problem: so far it was a theoretic workflow with dummy articles at the root. The additional scaffolding (folders for articles, dailies, images,...) had broken the publishing workflow
  - Use of generateId callback to abstract from the path / filename in the submodule (e.g. articles/2025-01-06-my-article has a slug articles/my-article instead of articles/articles/2025-01-06-my-article)
  - Implemented proper date prefixing to display articles chronologically in my IDE

- **Publish command overhaul**
  - Intent: break down monolithic publish command into focused single-responsibility scripts
  - Created separate scripts for content update and deployment to enable independent testing and better error isolation
  - Frontmatter validation:
    - Enhanced frontmatter validation script with better UX including success messages and directory exclusions
    - Integrated validation into publish pipeline to catch errors before deployment rather than during build

- **Learnings about images in Astro**:
  - Evaluated 5 different image handling options (Astro assets, markdown-it plugins, custom components, external services, basic CSS)
  - Chose basic CSS approach for immediate compatibility with anticipated Content Layer API migration path
