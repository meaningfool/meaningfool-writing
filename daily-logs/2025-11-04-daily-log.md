## Analysis

- **Designed AI-Powered Career Coaching System**:
  - Created a structured coaching repository with clear separation of concerns: `coaching-design/` (static design files), `coaching-sessions/` (individual session records), `analysis/` (rolling analysis files)
  - Established a **Divergence → Convergence** structure for the coaching process:
    - Phase 1 (Divergence): Deep dives into 4 career directions + 6 projects to explore what's attractive and reveal preferences
    - Phase 2 (Convergence): Pattern synthesis, reality checks, decision framework, and 90-day action plan
  - Key architectural decision: Analysis files are "living documents" updated after each session, while session files remain untouched post-session as a record

- **Established AI Coaching Session Protocol**:
  - Start protocol: Check sessions-plan, read full context from coaching-design and analysis, read last session
  - During session: Capture emergent insights, track new anchors (directions/projects), identify connections, adapt session plan
  - End protocol: Create session file, update analysis files (directions, projects, patterns, preferences), recap with user, confirm next session topic
  - Each direction/project exploration explicitly asks "Connections to explore" to build cross-anchor understanding
