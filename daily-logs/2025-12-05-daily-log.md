## Analysis

- **Implemented Error Display and Visualization feature**:
  - Error toggle with badge showing total error count
  - Side panel listing all validation errors
  - Node/edge error selection from panel
  - Visual distinction: Passive (static red border) vs Active (flashing ring) errors
  - Enhanced error messages with node labels for context

- **Created Test Stabilization Plan**:
  - Identified need for Page Object Model (POM) to reduce duplication
  - Fixture reorganization by feature
  - Shift complex logic validation from E2E to unit tests
  - E2E test pruning to reduce flakiness and execution time

- **Researched CSS Ripple Effect for error visualization**:
  - Problem: `animate-pulse` affects entire node (messy visuals)
  - Solution: CSS pseudo-element ripple that expands outward, independent of node content

## Commit Learnings

> *   **Accumulated Regressions**: Enforce full regression testing at the end of *every* feature cycle.
> *   **Impact on Shared Components**: Explicitly identify shared components being modified and flag dependent tests.
> *   **Evolving vs. New Tests**: Evolve existing test suites instead of creating isolated, monolithic fixtures.
> *   **Flaky Foundations**: Pay down technical debt in test foundations *before* building complex new features.
> *   **Debugging 'Complexity bias'**: Check for simple selector or text mismatches *first* before assuming complex concurrency issues.
> *   **Visual Verification First**: Prioritize visual inspection to distinguish between broken features and broken tests.
