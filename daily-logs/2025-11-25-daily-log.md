## Reading

- A semantic grep as a CLI tool with mgrep. This unlocks use cases involving "RAG", at least for a prototyping phase involving Claude Code SDK https://elite-ai-assisted-coding.dev/p/boosting-claude-faster-clearer-code
- 2nd time I hear about this "Effect" framework Seems to be a strange but powerful thing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHpf_XMz_aM. 


## Learning

- **TypeScript Best Practices**:
  - Avoid Non-Null Assertions (`!`) - use explicit guards or destructuring
  - "Parse, Don't Validate": Transform loose input into strict types at the boundary
  - Use Type Predicates (`isNode(n)`) instead of `as Node[]` for type safety
- **React Patterns**:
  - Controlled vs Uncontrolled: Start with Controlled for critical UI components
  - Animation Cleanup: Use `onAnimationEnd` instead of `setTimeout` to avoid magic numbers
- **Refactoring Insights**:
  - Key-based Reset pattern for robust state reset in controlled components
  - Layered Architecture: Domain (parsing), State (hook), and UI layers
  - Explicit State Clearing on validation failure (YAGNI on unused complexity)
