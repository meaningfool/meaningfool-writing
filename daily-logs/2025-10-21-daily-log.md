- Experiment with Flux Lora on Fal

  - Talks about GPT-5 and how it "gets me"
  - A lot of context has to be provided for the agent to "get" what one is trying to do
  - Once an agent is able to infer / recreate that context from previous output we get into "get me" zone and removes the need for so much upfront context
