## Analysis

- **Completed Project Exploration Phase of Career Coaching (Session 07)**:
  - Explored remaining learning projects: Paris en Brève (10-year idea persistence, serendipity/discovery value) and WhatsApp Client (high risk/high reward, 6 technical blocks)
  - Key insight from Paris en Brève: "third project material" - simple version still requires mobile + voice + content generation blocks
  - WhatsApp Client classified as "later project" - need agent + mobile skills first, high technical risk with WhatsApp integration
  - Completed skills mapping: grounded industry-standard skills (retrieval optimization, agent building, voice AI, evals) to all 6 learning projects using job posting research
  - Each skill now has context sentence explaining how it's developed in that specific project
  - Phase 1 progress: Directions ✓, Projects ✓, Learning Topics next as third triangulation angle
