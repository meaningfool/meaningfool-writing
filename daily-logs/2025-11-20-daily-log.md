## Analysis

- **Completed CSV Import Phase 2 using strict TDD**:
  - Cycle 1: File-level validation (reject files missing required columns: id, title, type)
  - Cycle 2: Row-level validation (drop rows with invalid node types, show warnings)
  - Cycle 3: Deduplication (keep first occurrence of duplicate IDs)
  - Cycle 4: Multi-step wizard UX (separate upload step from results/feedback step)
  - All 5 E2E tests passing

- **Debugged Tailwind CSS visual regression**:
  - Issue: CSS classes present in HTML but no styles applied
  - Root cause 1: `@import "tw-animate-css"` in index.css referenced a removed package, causing silent CSS build failure
  - Root cause 2: Legacy `tailwind.config.js` (v3) conflicting with Tailwind v4's CSS-based configuration
  - Resolution: Removed broken import, deleted legacy config, restarted dev server
  - Takeaway: If styles missing but classes present, check for broken imports and config version conflicts

- **E2E Test Data Strategy decision**:
  - Use external fixture files for file-based features (CSV, JSON uploads) - enables manual verification
  - Use inline data for small (<10 lines) test-specific cases where test logic depends on specific values
  - Tradeoff: Fixture files create "two-file problem" but worth it for complex file-based testing

## Learnings

- **E2E Test Data Strategy**: Use external fixture files for file-based features (CSV, JSON uploads) to enable manual verification by users and QA, even though it creates a "two-file problem" where tests and data must be kept in sync. Use inline data for small (<10 lines), test-specific cases where the test logic depends tightly on specific values and readability is paramount.
