## Analysis

- **Implemented Lineage Isolation feature (subtree highlighting)**:
  - Focus Toggle UI in Node Details panel
  - Recursive graph traversal for upstream/downstream highlighting
  - Dimming of unrelated nodes (opacity 0.1)
  - Background click to dismiss focus
  - Robust handling of cycles and self-loops

- **Updated merge policy for "Learning in Public"**:
  - Changed from Squash and Merge to Standard Merge (`--no-ff`)
  - Preserves full commit history showing actual development process (wip, fixes, etc.)
  - Aligns with goal of transparent learning rather than sanitized history

- **Defined Camera Control spec**:
  - Auto-fit all nodes on initial load
  - Context-aware error navigation (center on single node or fit cycle component)
  - Subtree focus fits the highlighted lineage

- **Started Demo Preparation**:
  - Visual polish for professional appearance
  - Demo scenario and fixture design for video showcase

## Learnings

- **Explicit State for Attention vs. Derived State**: Visual "attention grabbing" mechanisms (flashing, bouncing) should be driven by events (clicking a side panel item), not just static properties. Deriving "flashing error" from `isSelected && hasError` led to poor UX where simply selecting a node triggered panic-like animation.
- **Transitions vs. Analysis**: For data-heavy validations, prefer "crisp" (instant) feedback over smooth transitions. Smooth transitions "muddy the waters" during analysis.
- **System Load & Timeouts**: Stale processes (node, playwright) consuming >1.5GB RAM can cause widespread test timeouts. Fix with `pkill -f "playwright|test:e2e|next"`.

## Raw Commits

- `831cefe` docs: update merge policy to Standard Merge (no-ff) for public learning
- `9e6c39b` feat(lineage): subtree highlighting & interaction refinements
- `beef666` docs(camera): define spec for camera behavior (load, error, subtree)
