- Geoff Huntley Amazon Kiro analysis https://ghuntley.com/amazon-kiro-source-code/
- Looked into Beads: worth considering for spec management https://github.com/steveyegge/beads
- MCP is the wrong abstraction (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYZjVAodoo), I had read the Cloudflare article about MCP being RPC, but did not fully grasp until this video.
- Future of Bun (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSIgEJSi0rY): great analysis of the landscape and why becoming the place where agent code runs is key for Bun. Also need to further investigate the multiple responsibilities taken by bun.
- Vite won (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w61mLV5nZK0) learnt about bundler
- Python, Go, Rust, TypeScript and AI with Armin Ronacher https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/python-go-rust-typescript-and-ai
