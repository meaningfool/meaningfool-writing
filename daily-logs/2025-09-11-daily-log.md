# Activity Log - 2025-09-11

- **Github submodules implementation for personal site**
  - Tags: content management, implementation
  - Intent: group all my writing in a single repo, including the articles published on my personal site
  - Issues and learnings:
    - Submodule pointers mechanics: 
      - When the content in the submodule repo is updated (commit + push), the pointer from the repo pointing remains on the same commit.  
      - To point towards the last commit, the pointer needs to be updated, commited and pushed
    - At first I wanted a fully automated publication meachnism: "new content pushed => automatic rebuild"
      - This implied running 2 Github Actions sequentially: 1- the submodule auto update, 2- the Astro rebuild
      - GITHUB_TOKEN don't allow for that. It requires a PAT (Personal Access Token) approach.
      - After trying I changed course to have a manual deployment process for now.
    - Exclusion patterns to exclude files that are not .md or are not articles to be processed by Astro

- **Track actions and decisions using a devlog.md**
  - Tags: personal operating system
  - Intent: keep track of the development trajectory that can be hard to extract from Github commits.
  - Problem to solve: 
    - I started with a plan.md capturing the "grand scheme", but did not want to pollute it with fine-grained consideration.
    - I ended up starting another file tracking progress, what was tested, what failed and why, and the successive decisions. 
    - This file ended up capturing both the plan and the logs. 
  - Creating a separate log file so that I can see if plans and logs can be kept separate or if I need to move towards another organization

- **Create a /daily command to track daily activity**
  - Tags: personal operating system
  - Intent: automatically create a publishable summary of my activity / learnings on a daily basis
  - Approach: 
    - Started with the analysis of the git history for the given day (other types of activities could be captured and added later)
    - Used a mix of prompting and bash commands to make the execution of certain parts more deterministic (such as the retrieval of commits) and hopefully faster (less thinking)
