## Analysis

- **Welcome modal refinements**:
  - Added "how it works" image explaining CSV to graph transformation
  - Refined text and removed features list for cleaner appearance

- **Configured static export and deployment**:
  - Next.js 15 static export requires `output: 'export'` in `next.config.ts`
  - Added `trailingSlash: true` for better Cloudflare Pages compatibility
  - Strategy: Cloudflare Pages for `lineage.meaningfool.net` subdomain

- **Merged finishing touches feature**:
  - Zod 4.x schema error handling learnings
  - Decoupled validation schemas from user-facing messages

## Commit Learnings

> * Zod 4.x uses 'invalid_value' code and '.values' property for enum/literal failures, which aren't always reflected in standard types.
> * Used a 'Narrow Interface' ({ values?: string[] }) and 'as unknown as Narrow' to safely probe for this metadata without using 'any'.
> * Decoupled Zod schemas from user-facing messages by centralizing error formatting in the Importer layer for dynamic decoration and path mapping.
