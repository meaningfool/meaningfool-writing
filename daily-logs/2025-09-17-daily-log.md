# Activity Log - 2025-09-17

- **Clean up development planning artifacts reflecting new approach**
  - Problem: following the attempt to use issues and devlog to plan and log what was done, the conclusion was that:
    - It was cumbersome in many respects, and did not solve the issue of collecting valuable insights to create worthy daily activity logs
    - I was attempting to automate the creation of something I had never tried to create manually. So I would focus on writing good logs first before automating the process.
  - Remove AI orchestration issue tracking system (devlog.md, issues.md)
  - Remove slash commands for issue management (/issue, /close)
