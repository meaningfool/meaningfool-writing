## Analysis

- **Developed "Cost of Change" Article with Design Philosophy Analysis**:
  - Formulated time-to-ship equation and identified cost of change as a key lever (alongside talent and effort)
  - Explored the BDUF vs XP divide through the lens of different purposes for lowered cost of change:
    - BDUF: Lower cost of change as an end (reduce rework via upfront design)
    - XP: Lower cost of change as a means (embrace change via technical practices)
  - Introduced the concept of **subadditivity of cost of change** - bundling forces that make combined changes cheaper than sequential ones
  - Explored assumption vs change dynamics and when rework becomes acceptable
