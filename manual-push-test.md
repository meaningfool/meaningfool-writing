# Manual Push Test Article

This article was created to test the manual push workflow as part of Phase 2.1 testing.

## Test Purpose

This test aims to confirm whether the GitHub token limitation prevents automatic workflow triggering by:

1. Manually updating the submodule pointer (not via workflow)
2. Pushing changes manually 
3. Observing if the deployment workflow auto-triggers

## Expected Results

- If deployment workflow triggers automatically → GitHub token limitation confirmed
- If deployment workflow does NOT trigger → Different issue exists

## Test Date

Created on: January 11, 2025
