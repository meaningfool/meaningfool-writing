- I'm basically recreating the user stories epic or at least this hierarchy and the idea that issues can be open, closed and so on. And actually I'm not doing it because I think that's a nice way to do things. But rather because having some structure here will help me capture what's happening with the LLM and what we are building.

Because right now there is a lot of things that go in the chat and that get lost. And yeah, it's really the documenting aspect of things. And to probably document we need some structure. I would probably want to do without all of that.

And if, you know, but that would mean recording the conversation and having some kind of assistance that would basically be able to kind of process the mess of the conversation. And kind of distill it into a smart form. And basically be able to have questions and answers. But that's not something I can do right now with cloud code.

So it's basically I'm getting back to forms that already exist. But for, I guess, different reasons than they were created. Because here it's not about handoffs. It's about documenting the work.
