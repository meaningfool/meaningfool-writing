# AI Orchestration Development Log

This log captures the evolution of tooling and automation infrastructure for the meaningfool-writing content repository.

## 2025-09-12 - Session Management & Date Organization Fixes

**Intent**: Resolved critical issues with the daily command's data organization and session management.

**What Changed**:
- **Directory Naming Logic**: Fixed the fundamental flaw where data collection directories were named with current timestamp instead of target date. Previously running `/daily 2025-09-11` would create `20250912_094551` (today's date), now creates `target-2025-09-11_run-20250912_094551` (target date + run time).
- **Session File Colocation**: Moved session state files from root `.daily_session` into the data collection directories as `session.env`. This eliminates conflicts between concurrent runs and makes each data collection self-contained.
- **Data Replacement Strategy**: Implemented proper logic to replace existing data when re-running analysis for the same target date, preventing accumulation of multiple runs per date.

**Why Changed**: 
User discovered that analyzing different historical dates on the same day would overwrite each other's data due to timestamp-based naming. The session file was also orphaned in the root, causing state conflicts.

**Technical Details**:
- Modified `create_data_dir()` to accept target date parameter
- Updated `check_existing_data()` to use target-date-based directory search patterns  
- All scripts now source session files from within data directories
- Added cleanup logic to remove old data when re-running collection

## 2025-09-11 - Daily Command Modular Architecture Implementation

**Intent**: Transform the daily development log generation from a monolithic script into a clean, maintainable slash command system.

**What Changed**:
- **Architecture Restructure**: Replaced single bash script with three-phase modular approach:
  - Phase 1 (`fetch-commits.sh`): GitHub API data collection and commit analysis
  - Phase 2 (`prepare-analysis.sh`): Data preparation and daily log template creation  
  - Phase 3 (`daily.md`): AI-powered analysis and insight extraction
- **Utility Framework**: Created `utils.sh` with reusable functions for date validation, GitHub API interactions, and data directory management
- **Local Data Storage**: Switched from system temp directories to local `.daily/` folder to eliminate permission prompts
- **Session Management**: Implemented `.daily_session` file to pass variables between phases

**Why Changed**:
Original implementation was a monolithic bash script that was difficult to debug and maintain. The modular approach provides better separation of concerns and easier testing.

**Technical Details**:
- Added comprehensive date parsing (YYYY-MM-DD, "yesterday", "-N days")
- Implemented commit detail collection including file diffs and CLAUDE.md changes
- Created analysis file templates for AI processing
- Added proper error handling and variable validation between phases

## 2025-09-11 - Publishing Command Implementation

**Intent**: Streamline the content publishing workflow with automated status checking and proper workflow chaining.

**What Changed**:
- **Dual Workflow Orchestration**: Created `/publish` command that sequences both content update and deployment workflows
- **Status Monitoring**: Added real-time workflow status checking with proper wait loops and error handling
- **Failure Handling**: Implemented comprehensive error detection with workflow run ID tracking and log references

**Why Changed**:
Manual workflow triggering required multiple steps and lacked visibility into completion status. Users needed a single command that would handle the entire publishing pipeline.

**Technical Details**:
- Uses GitHub CLI to trigger workflows and monitor status
- Implements proper wait loops with status polling
- Provides run IDs for debugging failed workflows
- Validates both content update and deployment completion

## 2025-09-11 - Content Repository Documentation System

**Intent**: Establish comprehensive documentation for the content-only repository workflow and AI assistant guidance.

**What Changed**:
- **CLAUDE.md Creation**: Comprehensive documentation covering repository architecture, publishing workflow, troubleshooting, and technical implementation details
- **Frontmatter Validation System**: Added validation commands and templates to prevent build failures from missing or incorrect article metadata
- **Workflow Documentation**: Detailed the Git submodule relationship between content repo and main site

**Why Changed**:
Needed clear documentation for both AI assistants and human collaborators on how the content repository functions within the larger site architecture.

**Technical Details**:
- Documents the submodule relationship: `meaningfool.github.io/src/content/writing/` → `meaningfool-writing`
- Provides frontmatter templates and validation bash commands
- Explains the manual publishing trigger: `gh workflow run update-content.yml --repo meaningfool/meaningfool.github.io`

## Architecture Patterns Established

**Command Structure**: Slash commands in `.claude/commands/` with supporting scripts in `.claude/scripts/`

**Data Organization**: Target-date-based directory structure with co-located session files

**Session Management**: Environment files within data directories to maintain state across command phases

**Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and user-friendly error messages with debugging information

**Documentation Strategy**: Self-documenting code with comprehensive CLAUDE.md for AI assistant context

## 2025-09-12 - AI Orchestration Infrastructure

**Intent**: Establish structured tracking system for tooling development and issue management.

**What Changed**:
- **Created `.ai-orchestration/` Directory**: Hidden directory for tooling-related tracking files
- **Implemented devlog.md**: Development log for capturing completed work with intent and rationale
- **Implemented issues.md**: Structured issue tracking with hierarchical ID system (MW-XXXX)
- **Updated CLAUDE.md**: Added comprehensive documentation about AI orchestration files

**Why Changed**:
Need systematic way to track tooling evolution and planned work, separate from content changes. This provides continuity across AI sessions and preserves decision history.

**Completed Issues**:
- ✓ MW-0001: Daily Command Data Organization (all sub-issues completed)
  - MW-0001-01: Fixed directory naming to use target date
  - MW-0001-02: Moved session files into data directories  
  - MW-0001-03: Implemented proper data replacement logic
