# Test Automated Workflow

This article was created to test the automated content update workflow between the writing repository and the main site.

## How It Works

1. Content is added to the writing repository
2. A webhook triggers the main site to update
3. The site rebuilds and deploys automatically

This should appear on the site within minutes of being committed.
