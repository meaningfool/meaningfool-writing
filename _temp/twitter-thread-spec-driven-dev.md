# Twitter Thread: Spec-driven development has it backwards

## Tweet 1 (Hook)
Spec-driven development has it backwards.

It promotes a traditional top-down / big design upfront approach in order to fix a real but temporary LLM flaw ðŸ§µ

## Tweet 2
The fundamental LLM issue is that LLM have a high cost of change. 

They are much better at starting from scratch than at making changes.

High cost of change incentivizes investing time upfront to get it right the first time.

## Tweet 3
As LLMs/agents get better I would expect that:
- Specs implicitly emerge from conversations, as analytical records of decisions made, not upfront requirements.
- Specs form a basis for higher-level discussion when needed
- Design happens as you go, as needed
