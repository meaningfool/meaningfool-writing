# Phase 1 Test Article

This article was created on **September 11, 2025** to test our Phase 1 fixes to the content workflow automation system.

## Purpose

The purpose of this article is to verify that:

1. **Submodule updates** are properly detected by our workflow
2. **Change detection** works with our new `git add src/content/writing` logic
3. **Production deployment** happens automatically when content changes
4. **End-to-end flow** functions as expected

## What We Fixed in Phase 1

- Added explicit branch tracking to `.gitmodules`
- Fixed the workflow to properly stage submodule changes
- Added better debugging and status messages
- Implemented proper exit codes for success/failure

## Expected Behavior

When this article is pushed to the `meaningfool-writing` repository:

1. The content workflow should detect "Content changes detected!"
2. A new commit should be created in the main repository
3. This article should appear on the production website
4. The article should be accessible at `/articles/phase1-test-article/`

## Test Timestamp

If you're reading this on the production website, it means our Phase 1 fixes worked! ðŸŽ‰
