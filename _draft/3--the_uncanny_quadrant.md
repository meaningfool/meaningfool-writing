# The uncanny quadrant

**There is value in slicing the work (vertically)**
Thinner slices means faster iterations
Unless...

**Unless you have high cost of change**
High cost of change incentivizes bundling the work
High cost of change is an antagonist force that brings you back to fatter slices.

**Thin slices with high cost of change is a weird spot**
Where you best efforts to iterate faster don't really move the needle

Retrospectivally, I can see how the chatter about slicing, INVEST, and so on
Is just noise

**Slicing only matters once your cost of change is low enough**
