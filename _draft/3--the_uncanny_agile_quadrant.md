# The uncanny Agile quadrant

Slicing the work, of all Agile "practices", is the most impactful one.
Or so it seems, at least in the product management community.
How to slice, not to slice, INVEST, and so on.

And indeed, if you can slice into smaller vertical pieces, there is less work to get it in front of users.
And so a shorter time to the next iteration.
Smaller slices means faster iterations, and faster value.

But there is a much stronger antagonist force at play: the cost of change.
High cost of change implies bundling the work


"Is this going to be like all the other times where we say we'll iterate, but we stop after V1?"\
This was our Head of design laying down the hard truth

Indeed we did not iterate. 
And that's despite slicing work to the point our V1 was barely good enough for our customers to use.

That's because the next slices, however small, were disproportionately costly to implement.
We had high cost of change and you could tell because we were "bundling"
We waited until we had enough changes to be made on a given scope before making any in order to save rework.


Perfectly (vertically) sliced user stories aren't enough to iterate rapidly.\
Actually slicing work while having high cost of change gets you in that weird spot,
This uncanny quadrant where you strive for faster iteration but your cost of change is pulling you back towards bundling and larger scopes.

Once technical cost of change diminish, org cost of change come under pressure

At this point devs have an incentive to devise better organisation patterns in context 

**Organizational cost of change naturally follows from lowering technical cost of change**
