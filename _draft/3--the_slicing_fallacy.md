# The Slicing Fallacy

**Slice, baby, slice**
That's how you're going to iterate faster.
Or is it?

You sliced that feature into 3 iterations
But wait!
Iteration 2 implies to rework a lot that happened in iteration 1
Could we not just ship them together?

And actually, with the tests, the CI/CD and whatnot
We'll spend just as much time working on the releases as working on the feature.
Can't we just do a single release?

**When 2 changes cost more than a larger one, you bundle.**
That's what Cost of Change does: 
The higher it is, the stronger the incentives to delay and bundle.

And when you bundle, you are not iterating, you are just chunking the work.
So:

**You cannot slice your way out of slow iterations**
That's the slicing fallacy.
Slicing helps with iterating faster only when change is already cheap.
