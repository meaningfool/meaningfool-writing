# The Slicing Fallacy

**You cannot slice your way out of slow iterations**
Despite what's commonly claimed. 
That's the slicing fallacy.

**Because slicing only works when change is cheap.**
The higher the Cost of Change the stronger the "bundling" forces:
When 2 small changes cost more than a larger one, you bundle the work.

**Slicing with high Cost of Change is like swimming against the tide.**
Iterations speed does not pick up: the frictions are too high.
Thin slices get thicker and bundled together.

**The only escape route is to reduce Cost of Change first.**
