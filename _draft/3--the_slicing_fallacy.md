# The Slicing Fallacy

**You cannot slice your way out of slow iterations**
Despite what's commonly claimed. That's the slicing fallacy.
Because only lower cost of change will.

**Slicing only works when change is cheap.**
Because high cost of change creates an incentive to bundle the work.
Cost of change is subadditive, meaning cost(A) + cost(B) > cost(A+B)
Cost of change is a gravity force: the higher it is, the harder it is to escape it.

**Slow and bulky iterations are self-reinforcing**
Stakeholders understand this math intuitively:
If the next iteration is far away
You preemptively load the first release with everything they can.

**The only escape route is to reduce cost of change first.**
Once the additional cost of thinner slices becomes bearable
Can you start to iterate more often.
