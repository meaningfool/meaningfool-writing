thought: The world is divided into 2 camps: the prolifics and the frugals. AI is in the prolific camp - there are prolific persons that will create extensive materials, e.g. don't craft prompt but ask AI to generate prompts. Frugal person add only what's been proven to be necessary. The best approach would be to go fast where AI meets "good enough" but stop and craft where it matters. Critical skill will be to know where to dash forward where to stop.

thought: the bigger the system the higher the probability that it grows.
