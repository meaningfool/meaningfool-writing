# Cost of Change is Agile's ceiling

**I long believed that slicing the work was a pillar of Agile.**
Smaller chunks meant delivering value faster.
Smaller chunks meant the ability to reduce WIP and increase flow.
As a PM that's also what I kept hearing and reading about.


**Until I discovered it's only half of the story.** 
Cutting things into ever tinier pieces
Won't move the needle if cost of change is high.


**Cost of change is what it sounds like:**
It's the time it costs for making a change, but also planning, debugging,  deploying...


**High Cost of change incentivizes Anticipation**
Expensive changes means you better know precisely what you are doing before you do it.
Expensive changes means it makes sense to invest time in upfront planning and design.


**High Cost of change incentivizes larger scopes and fewer iterations.**
Because 2 small changes are more expensive than a larger one.


**Cost of Change is Agile's ceiling.**
When change is expensive, waterfall is the rational choice.


**But product people don't talk about it (or do they?)**
Maybe because the very role of Product Manager depends on high Cost of change.


**So what happens if/when AI collapses the software cost of change?**
Do we finally get to be more Agile?
Do we still need product managers?
