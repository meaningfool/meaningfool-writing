**Slow and bulky iterations are self-reinforcing**
Stakeholders understand this math intuitively:
If the next iteration is far away
You preemptively load the first release with everything they can.

think of a liquid, the viscous forces but the other way around

# The Anticipation Game

**Slow iterations are self-reinforcing.**
From slow you go to slower.
Not because of technical reasons.
Because of incentives.

**Imagine you're told the next release is 3 months away.**
You have a feature request.
You could ask for the minimal version now, refine it later.
But "later" is 3 months away.
Maybe longer.
Maybe never.

**So you don't wait.**
You cram everything you can think of into this release.
Extra fields. Edge cases. Nice-to-haves.
Better to get 80% of what you want now than 100% never.
It's rational behavior.

**Now add other stakeholders.**
They're doing the same calculation.
They're also cramming their requests.
And they know they might lose to you if they don't.

**Call it "Stakeholders Dilemma": if you cooperate, you lose.**

**Inevitably cycles get longer.**
Because complexity increases.
Because it's easier to delay than saying no.
Vindicating the belief that later might be never.

**Cost of change creates the anticipation game.**
When releases are expensive and infrequent,
Everyone plays it.
And everyone loses.
