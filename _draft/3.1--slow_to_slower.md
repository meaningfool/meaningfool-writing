# The Anticipation Game

**PM**
we can meet your demand on A, B and C for the first version of the feature. And we'll iterate from there: so we'll build E, F, and G once we have some user feedback.
does that work for you?

***Stakeholder (thinking)**
yes I can live with A, B, and C. Seems reasonable. And we can course-correct based on observations.*

***Stakeholder (still thinking)**
oh, but wait: last time we were supposed to iterate, when the v1 was actually delivered, after 3 months, the momentum was gone.*

*The urgency had shifted to something else. 
Onto the next big thing. 

*We never got to iterate. 
And the feature barely registers as "acceptable" for some customers.*

***Stakeholder (still thinking)**
and Donald, and Marco, they don't play nice
they just over-inflate their demands in order to get what they need.*

*If that's how the game is played...

**Stakeholder**
you know what, actually, we can't work without E, F and G
I really went for the bare minimum
and I realized I was actually taking a risk with some important customers
and you know they can be sensitive to first impression
so let's add H and I to the requirements.

**Call it "Stakeholders Dilemma": if you cooperate, you lose.**
Cost of change creates the anticipation game.
When releases are expensive and infrequent,
Everyone plays it.
And everyone loses.
