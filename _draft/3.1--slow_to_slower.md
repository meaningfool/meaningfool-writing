**Slow and bulky iterations are self-reinforcing**
Stakeholders understand this math intuitively:
If the next iteration is far away
You preemptively load the first release with everything they can.

think of a liquid, the viscous forces but the other way around

# The Anticipation Game

**Slow iterations are self-reinforcing.**
From slow you go to slower.
Not because of technical reasons.
Because of incentives.

**Imagine you're told the next release is 3 months away.**
You have a feature request.
You could ask for the minimal version now, refine it later.
But "later" is 3 months away.
Maybe longer.
Maybe never.

**So you don't wait.**
You cram everything you can think of into this release.
Extra fields. Edge cases. Nice-to-haves.
Better to get 80% of what you want now than 100% never.

**This is rational behavior.**
When the next train is 3 months away, you bring extra luggage.
When the next release is uncertain, you ask for extra scope.
It's not greed. It's math.

**Now add other stakeholders.**
They're doing the same calculation.
They're also cramming their requests.
If you don't, you're just accepting delay.
So you ask for even more, to compensate for what might get cut.

**The release gets heavier.**
More features means more complexity.
More complexity means longer development.
Longer development means the next release gets pushed out.
Now it's 4 months away.

**Next time, you cram even more.**
Because the cycle taught you: ask big or wait longer.
The gap widens. The releases get heavier.
Slow makes slower.

**This is the opposite of iteration.**
Real iteration depends on trust that "later" exists.
That you can be modest now because you'll get another chance soon.
But when later is far away or uncertain,
Anticipation becomes the only rational strategy.

**Cost of change creates the anticipation game.**
When releases are expensive and infrequent,
Everyone plays it.
And everyone loses.
