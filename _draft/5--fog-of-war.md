- There is no difference between functional spec and technical spec / fog of war
- Positional uncertainty
- Discurssive vs analytical


# Fog of war

**Building a solution is navigating a decision tree.**

Each node is a choice. From big architectural decisions at the top, to implementation details at the leaves.


**The problem: You don't always know where you are in the tree.**

Are you close to a leaf? Or still high up with many decisions ahead?
This uncertainty is the fog of war.


**AI assumes it knows where you are.**
It's confident. It gives you specific solutions.
But it's often wrong about the depth.


**When you're at a leaf, AI is magic.**
You know exactly what you want. You give precise instructions.
AI executes perfectly.


**When you're higher up, things get murky.**
Experienced developers can still define what they want precisely.
They lift their own fog through expertise.


**But most people don't know where they are.**
Especially those using AI to become developers.
They can't give precise instructions because they haven't explored the sub-tree yet.


**AI should help with exploration.**
But it doesn't. Because AI has high cost of change.
Go down one branch, need to backtrack? AI struggles.


**So you need to prototype. To throw away work.**
To lift the fog yourself before AI can help.
This is the tax of uncertainty.


**The irony: AI works best when you need it least.**
When you already know what you want.
When the fog is already lifted.

When you're still exploring? You're on your own.
