# Why We Can't Stop Planning (Even When We Should)

Planning is a psychological need.\
Planning is a high social-status activity.\
Planning is self-reinforcing.



We don't plan just because it's valuable. But because it's an urge. 



**We plan because planning feels professional and responsible**. \
Anticipating future problems signals expertise. \
And unanticipated issues  signal unpreparedness at best, incompetence at worst.&#x20;



**We plan because we can't resist adding to the list.**\
We can't resist "brain dumping", because it's easier than withholding or forgetting.\
We hoard ideas, good and bad, scared  we might forget.\
We order, reorder, discuss, schedule and align. We love grooming those lists of ours.



**We plan because we fear uncertainty.**\
We plan because we need the sense of control it provides.



**We  over-index the value of planning because change is scary.**\
We over-index the value of planning in order to justify our urge to plan. \
We over index the value of planning because we did not keep up with the decrease of the cost of change.



**When change is free,  planning is pointless.**\
When you can revert past decisions at no cost, \
When you can switch directions instantly, \
Anticipation is not only a waste of time, \
Anticipation is also a waste of optionality.



**Anti-planning as the action of deliberately and actively not planning, is a skill.**\
Anti-planning means knowing when to invest in planning, and when to delay decisions.\
Delay decisions until the last responsible moment as would say Poppendieck.\
Anti-planning means resisting personal and organizational urges to plan.



**Anti-planning's value skyrockets as the cost of change collapses**\
Vanishing cost of change lowers the bar as to what decisions can be delayed.\
But people not used to actively searching to delay probably did not notice
