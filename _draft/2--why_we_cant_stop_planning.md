# We Can't Stop Planning (Even When We Should)

**We are pathological planners.**
We should have a word for that: planopathia anticipationis
We don't plan just because it's valuable. 
But because it's an urge. 

**We plan because planning feels professional and responsible**. 
Anticipating future problems signals expertise. 
Unanticipated issues signal unpreparedness at best, incompetence at worst.

**We plan because we can't resist adding to the list.**
We can't resist "brain dumping", because it's easier than withholding or forgetting.
We hoard ideas, good and bad, scared  we might forget.
We order, reorder, discuss, schedule and align. We love tending to those lists of ours.

**We plan because we fear uncertainty.**
We need the sense of control it provides.
It's our copium.

**Planning is actually not a defect, it's been hardwired through evolution**
When so many dangers loom that survival hangs to anticipate what could go wrong,
When the world is a place where cost of change is infinitely high (death)
Planning is highly desirable. And over-planning preferable to under-planning.

**But where change is cheap, planning is irresponsible.**
When you can revert past decisions at no cost, 
When you can switch directions instantly, 
Anticipation is not only a waste of time, 
Anticipation is also a waste of optionality.

**Cost of change is dropping and we did not notice**
Or rather our hardwired brain has a hard time adjusting.
Meaning we miss-allocate our energy where cost of change used to be high, 
Instead of where it's remaining relatively higher.

**AI shifts the cost of change landscape, but not uniformely**
Those who can intentionally not plan, 
Who can resist the incentives to do so,
Are the most likely to gradient-ascent this new reality.
