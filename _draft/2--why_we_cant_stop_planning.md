# We Can't Stop Planning (Even When We Should)

**We are pathological planners.**
We should have a word for that: planopathia anticipationis
We don't plan just because it's valuable. 
But because it's an urge. 


**We plan because planning feels professional and responsible**. 
Anticipating future problems signals expertise. 
Unanticipated issues signal unpreparedness at best, incompetence at worst.


**We plan because we can't resist adding to the list.**
We can't resist "brain dumping", because it's easier than withholding or forgetting.
We hoard ideas, good and bad, scared  we might forget.
We order, reorder, discuss, schedule and align. We love tending to those lists of ours.


**We plan because we fear uncertainty.**
We need the sense of control it provides.


**We value planning more than it's worth**
First, because it's our copium.
But also because we don't notice 
When cost of change is dropping


**Where change is cheap, planning is irresponsible.**
When you can revert past decisions at no cost, 
When you can switch directions instantly, 
Anticipation is not only a waste of time, 
Anticipation is also a waste of optionality.


**Delay decisions until the last responsible moment** (Poppendieck)
That means intentionally not planning, resisting the incentives
Anti-planning means resisting personal and organizational urges to plan.



**Anti-planning's value skyrockets as the cost of change collapses**
Vanishing cost of change lowers the bar as to what decisions can be delayed.
But people not used to actively searching to delay probably did not notice



Planning is self-reinforcing.
