# Prolifics and frugals

**The world splits into prolifics and frugals.**

**Prolifics create a lot.**
They attempt many things. 
They don't refine much, they multiply instead.

**Frugals distill a lot.**
They care about signal over noise. 
They're attached to simplicity. 
To differences that make a difference.

**AI is clearly on the prolific side.**
It's verbose. 
It produces fast. 
It assumes a lot. 

**Prolifics are best positioned to leverage AI**
It fits their nature.
It amplifies their natural inclination.
But unless they can harness AI to better distill 
They are at risk of drowning in their own output

**So frugals may actually benefit the most**
If they can add volume to their production.
If they can get started and deal with the initial mess.
At least for a moment. 
Long enough to figure out how to work with their new prolific partner.
