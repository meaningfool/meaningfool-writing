# Prolifics and frugals

**The world splits into prolifics and frugals.**

Prolifics create a lot. They attempt many things. They don't refine much - they multiply instead.

Frugals care about signal over noise. They're attached to simplicity. To differences that make a difference.


**This requires time.**
Time that goes against multiplication. Fewer outputs, but more distilled.


**AI is clearly on the prolific side.**
It's verbose. It produces fast. But it fails to extract essence.
It always has a low signal-to-noise ratio.


**The challenge differs by type.**
Frugals need to go against their bias - produce more, then distill.
Prolifics risk drowning in their own output - they need to find the signal.


**Short term, prolifics have an advantage.**
AI aligns with their natural inclination.
But volume without signal is just noise.


**The real question: Can you adopt AI without it amplifying your weakness?**
Can prolifics add curation to their multiplication?
Can frugals add distillation to their volume?

Or does AI just make us more of what we already are?
