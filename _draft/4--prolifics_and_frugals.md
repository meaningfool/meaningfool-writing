# Prolifics and frugals

**The world splits into prolifics and frugals.**

**Prolifics create a lot.**
They attempt many things. 
They don't refine much, they multiply instead.

**Frugals prefer to distill.**
They care about signal over noise. 
They care about simplicity,
About differences that make a difference.

**AI is the prolific genie.**
It's verbose. 
It produces fast. 
It assumes a lot. 

**Prolifics are best positioned to leverage AI**
It fits their nature.
It amplifies their natural inclination.
But can they not drown in their own output (slop?)

**Frugals may actually benefit the most**
If they can add volume to their production.
If they can automate distillation.
If they can get started and deal with the initial mess.
At least for a moment. 
Long enough to figure out how to work with their new prolific partner.
