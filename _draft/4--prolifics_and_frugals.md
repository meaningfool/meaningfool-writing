# Prolifics and frugals

**The world splits into prolifics and frugals.**

**Prolifics create a lot.**
They attempt many things. 
They don't refine much, they multiply instead.

**Frugals distill a lot.**
They care about signal over noise. 
They're attached to simplicity. 
To differences that make a difference.

**AI is clearly on the prolific side.**
It's verbose. 
It produces fast. 
It assumes a lot. 

**Prolifics are best positioned to leverage AI**
It fits their nature.
It amplifies their natural inclination.

**At the risk of drowning in their own output**
Because AI won't help where they lack
As it struggles to extract essence.

**Frugals may actually benefit the most**
If they can add volume to their production.
If they can find a way to harness AI.
Which means experimenting prolifically first...
