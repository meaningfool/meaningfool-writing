# Cost of Change: The Missing Half of Agile

**I long believed that slicing the work was at the foundation of  Agile.**\
Smaller chunks meant delivering value faster.\
Smaller chunks meant the ability to reduce WIP and increase flow.\
As a PM that's also what I kept hearing and reading about.\


**Until I discovered it's only half of the story.** \
Cost of change is the other half.\
Cost of change is the time it takes to make a change, but also plan, debug,  deploy...

\
**Cost of change is Agile's ceiling.**\
The harder, the longer it takes to make a change, the less agile you can be. 



Let's break this down.\
\
**High Cost of change breeds "get it right the first time" mindsets.**\
When  changes are expensive, you better know precisely what you are doing before you do it.\
When changes are expensive, it makes sense to invest time in upfront planning and design.



**High Cost of change incentivize delaying and bundling the work.** \
When 2 changes at once cost less than 2 changes separately\*, it makes sense to bundle changes. \
The higher the cost of change, the more sense it makes to delay changes until they can be bundled in larger deliveries.



**With high Cost of change, Agile is out of reach.**\
Because high cost of change favors larger scopes and fewer iterations.\
When change is expensive, waterfall is the rational choice.



**Cost of change is the largely underrated driver of what you can achieve.**\
Cost of change dictates how the work is done.\
Cost of change dictates what your options are.\
I wish someone had laid this out that clearly to me.\


Looking forward



**What happens when AI collapses the software cost of change?**\
What are the non-software costs of change that remain?\
How is the work organization changing?\
Do we keep planning as much as we do?



**How is the  cost of change different for data and AI products?**\
Can we expect that tooling and practices will bring data and models cost of change down as it did for code?\
What roles will be impacted first as the cost of change decreases? 



\*Cost of change is subadditive meaning that $cost(x+y)<cost(x)+cost(y)$. As illustration linear functions such as $h(x)=ax+b$ with $a,b > 0$ are subadditive.
