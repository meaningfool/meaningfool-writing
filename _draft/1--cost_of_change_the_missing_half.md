# Cost of Change is Agile's ceiling

**I long believed that slicing the work was at the foundation of  Agile.**
Smaller chunks meant delivering value faster.
Smaller chunks meant the ability to reduce WIP and increase flow.
As a PM that's also what I kept hearing and reading about.


**Until I discovered it's only half of the story.**Â 
Cutting things into ever tinier pieces
Won't move the needle if cost of change is high.


**Cost of change is what it sounds like:**
It's the time it costs for making a change, but also planning, debugging,  deploying...


**Cost of change++ == Anticipate++**
Expensive changes means you better know precisely what you are doing before you do it.
Expensive changes means it makes sense to invest time in upfront planning and design.


**High Cost of change incentivizes delaying and bundling the work.**
That means larger scopes and fewer iterations.
When change is expensive, waterfall is the rational choice.


**So Cost of Change is Agile's ceiling.**
It's the tide you are swimming against
But surprisingly, product people don't talk about it.


**The very role of Product Manager depends on high Cost of change**
Because high Cost of Change makes specialization and coordination inevitable.


**So what happens if/when AI collapses the software cost of change?**
What is now the limiting factor? 
What happens to Product Managers?
Do we keep anticipating and planning as much as we do?
